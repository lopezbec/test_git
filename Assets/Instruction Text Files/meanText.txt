@Observe your data. You will notice that the 
processing times between parts are not exactly 
the same, but tend to have a center.
Press A to continue or B to go back.
@This center is the sample arithmetic average 
of these processing times. Arithmetic average or mean 
of a set of sample data values. In our case, 
the processing times can be calculated 
using the following equation shown here.

@In other words, we need to add up all 
the processing times and divide the sum 
by the number of values.

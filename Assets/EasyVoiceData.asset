  - 'Hello!   Welcome to our virtual reality learning modules. This environment mimics
    a facility that manufactures power drills. The learning modules aim to connect
    the knowledge that you learn in different Industrial Engineering courses. Select
    one of the modules to start interacting with the environment to learn about the
    concepts.      To start look to your right at the modules board. To get there,
    use the joystick on the left controller to point the teleportation circle to
    a location close to the modules board. When released it will teleport you to
    the modules board where you can reach out and hover over a module to select it.
    Once selected, the module will display on this board and you will have options
    to go Next, Previous, or Help if needed. '
  - "Before you go further, let me describe this facility for you. This manufacturing
    facility produces electric power drills. Drills are power tools that can process
    holes through different types of materials. They can also be used to drive screws
    into softer materials like wood.   In this room, you can disassemble a power
    drill to see its components. Go to the classroom and check it out \u2026 "
  - 'A power drill consists of a drive unit and a gear unit. The drive unit is the
    back part of the drill that includes the electric motor. The gear unit is the
    front part that includes the spindle that turns the drill bit. The line you will
    see manufactures the plastics housing of the drive unit, assembles the components
    inside the housings to create a power drill.   Please follow me to the line.
    Here we can see an injection molding press that produces the plastics housing
    of the power drill.  They are placed in a conveyor to cool down. A robot arm
    picks defective parts and places them in a bin. The good parts are placed in
    another bin at the end of the conveyer belt. Once a bin is full, they are transported
    to another area of the facility where the assembly of the drill takes place.  '
  - 'If you look behind the injection molding machine, you will see various controllers
    to change the production rate speed and probability distribution, number of housings
    per batch/press, and the probability distribution of the number of defective
    units.   The robot arm speed can also be changed using the control pad behind
    the robot arm. '
  - "Welcome to the Mean Introduction module.  The arithmetic mean is a measurement
    of location  that also represents a numerical summary of data.  The data that
    is being refered  to can be sample or population. \nSample data is used to draw 
    conclusions about the population.  Notations and context help distinguish  between
    sample and population measures. "
  - 'Now observe one of the injection molding machines, you will notice that the
    times between the batches of the housings are not exactly the same due to the
    variability in the molding process. Additional variability comes from measuring
    errors (using the stopwatch). With all this variability, the collected values
    tend to have a center.   This center is the sample arithmetic average of these
    processing times. Arithmetic average or mean of a set of sample data values.
    In our case, the time between the batches of the housings (it is the processing
    times of the batches as well) can be calculated using the following equation
    shown here. '
  - "Welcome to the Median module. Similar to the mean, the median is a measurement
    of location that also represents a numerical summary of data.  \n\n\nThe median
    of a population is represented by X~(pronounced X tilde). The median for a sample
    data  is identified by first sorting the data from smallest to largest and then
    using the following:  "
  - "Welcome to the Mode module. Similar to the mean and median, the mode is a measurement
    of location that also represents a numerical summary of data.  \nThe mode for
    sample data  is the value that appears most often.    When we are dealing with
    categorical or discrete values-that is, frequency of a category or values without
    decimal points such as 10, 11, 12- the mode is the value that appears most often.   
    For example, if we count the number of parts we produce in 1hr- the number of
    parts is a discrete value since we cannot produce half of a part- in an 8hr shift,
    we can have something that looks like this: \n[51, 50, 45, 51, 52, 48, 51, 50] "
  - "In this example, the mode- the value that appears most often, is 51, which appears
    three times. Also, the mode might not be a unique value, for example, if we realize
    that in the 3rd hour of the shift we made 50 parts, not 45, there would be two
    modes 52 and 50\u2013 then this data set can be said to be bimodal. If the data
    set has more than two modes, it is said to be multimodal.   In the case we are
    dealing with continues data- that is, data that can take decimal values, such
    as part as processing times- we need to use \u201Cbins\u201D to help discretize
    the values. This will help us group the values in a table, and the mode is defined
    as the class interval where most observations lie. The mode is rarely used as
    a measure of central tendency for numeric variables. However, for categorical
    variables, the mode is more useful because the mean and median do not make sense.  "
  - Welcome to the Variability Introduction Module. Standard Deviation is the most
    commonly used measure of dispersion or variability. The larger the value of the
    sample standard deviation the larger the sample variability. The sample standard
    deviation is the  square root of the sample variance. The sample Standard Deviation
    of a population is represented by S and the sample Variance is  represented by
    S^2.
  - "This submodule deals with continuous random variables and the associated continuous
    probability distributions. If a sample space contains an infinite number of possibilities
    equal to the number of points on a line segment, it is called a continuous sample
    space. In the continuous case, we consider the probability of a random variable
    assuming any  particular value to be 0. This is because, in continuous space,
    we are considering numbers of infinite precision.  \n\nFor example, if we consider
    the random variable corresponding to the time between producing defective parts
    X, the number of values between 2.99 seconds and 3.01 seconds are uncountably
    infinite. Therefore, we assign the probabilities  associated with these individual
    values 0 and instead consider the probability that the random variable falls
    within a certain interval. In the above example, we could assign a non-zero probability
    to the interval 2 seconds to 3 seconds, i.e., P(2<X<3) "
  - "A continuous random variable can be represented by a probability density function.
    Because a probability density function is necessarily a function of the continuous
    random variable x, we express it as f(x). A probability density function should
    obey the following three properties: \n\nAs you see in property 3, the probability
    that a continuous random variable assumes a value on the interval [a, b] corresponds
    to the area underneath the probability density function over that interval. Click
    this button to generate a probability density function for the time between produced
    parts (should look something like the figure below). \n"
  - "Exponential Distribution  Recall the Poisson distribution from the discrete
    distributions submodule, the Poisson distribution described the probability of
    x events occurring (number of produced defective parts) within a specified time
    or specified region such as \u201Cdistance\u201D, \u201Cvolume\u201D, et., given
    that the mean rate of occurrence is known. The exponential distribution describes
    the probability distribution of the time between two consecutive events in a
    Poisson process. The probability density function of the exponential distribution
    is as follows: \n\n\nFor the example of the defective parts, the mean of the
    number of defective parts in a sample of three produced parts was mu=0.5 and
    followed a Poisson distribution, observe the generated theoretical probability
    density function for this variable. Guide the students to observe the generated
    probability density function. \n\nNow, observe the time between each two consecutive
    parts that produced by the injection molding machine and record these times using
    the stop watch. Collect these times for the parts produced within an interval
    of 500 seconds or more. Plot these values, does your probability density function
    matches the theoretical probability density function of the exponential distribution? "
  - "One way to summarize data is through the use of a frequency distribution, where
    the data is grouped into different classes or intervals, and the number of occurrences
    in each class is obtained. The relative frequency distribution is found by dividing
    the number of occurrences in each class by the total number of data points. A
    plot of the relative frequency  distribution is referred to as a histogram. \n\nData
    may be discrete or continuous. Thus, random variables could be  discrete or continuous.
    This submodule deals with discrete random variables and the associated discrete
    probability distributions. "
  - "Show histogram of data collected in the previous experiment. A random variable
    is a function that associates a real number with each element of a sample space
    of a statistical experiment. For example, in if we are collecting data about
    the number of defective parts that we observe every time we produce three parts,
    and assuming there is an experiment in which three parts are generated with a
    probability of one half that a part is defective, the sample space, S, will be
    we have the sample space: \n\n\n\nWhere N means a non-defective part and D means
    a defective part. We can assign each point in the sample space a numerical value
    corresponding to the number of non-defective parts in a sample of three partsafter
    three generations. We will  use a capital letter, for example, X, to denote a
    random variable for the number of non-defective parts and a corresponding small
    letter, x, for one of its values. In this example, the random variable X = 2
    for the elements in the subset of the sample space S\n\nNow observe the generation
    of three parts note the value of the random variable X = x for the sequence observed.
    After showing one of these experiments (generating three parts), generate data
    for 100 of these experiments, and show the histogram. If the sample space contains
    a finite number of possibilities or an unending  sequence with as many elements
    as whole numbers, it is called a discrete sample space. A discrete random variable
    associates a discrete sample space with real numbers. "
  - "A discrete random variable can be represented by a probability mass function.
    Because a probability mass function is necessarily a function of the discrete
    random variable X, we express it as f(x). A probability mass function should
    obey the following three properties: \n\n\n\n\nAs you see in property 3, discrete
    random variable assumes each value in the sample space with a certain probability.
    In the case of generating three parts above, the random variable X assumes the
    value 2 with probability 3/8, since 3 of the 8 sample points, which are equally
    likely, result in two non-defective parts. It is often convenient to represent
    all the probabilities of a random variable X by a function of the numerical values
    x, denoted f(x). Therefore we have f(x) = P(X = x), and f(2) = P(X=2) = 3/8.
    The set of ordered pairs (x,f(x)) is called the probability mass function or
    probability distribution of the discrete random variable X. For the part generation
    example, we have the probability mass function: "

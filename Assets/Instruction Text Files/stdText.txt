Welcome to the Variability Introduction module. 
@Standard deviation is the most commonly used
measure of dispersion or variability. 
@The larger the value of the sample standard 
deviation, the larger the sample variability. 
@The sample standard deviation is the 
square root of the sample variance. 
@The sample Standard Deviation of a population is
represented by S and the sample Variance is 
represented by S^2.
@Observe your data. You will notice that the 
processing times between parts are not exactly
the same, they are different.
@The standard deviation, S, can be 
calculated using the following equation. 
@~
@This calculation will give us the spread of the data. 
Use the calculator provided on the tool table.
Then submit your answer to the blackboard number pad.
